      Ink Saver Main is the cornerstone ability of almost any E-Liter. The average build sees anywhere from 9–30 AP dedicated 
      strictly to this ability. 10 AP is enough for a full extra shot. On top of that, low amounts of Ink Saver Main have a tremendous 
      effect on how long it takes to refill ink for another shot. This is an ability you never want to sleep on.
      </p>
    <p id="iss">
        Ink Saver Sub can be useful at times on Vanilla E-Liter. The weapon as a whole is pretty ink hungry, and sometimes you may find 
        yourself out of ink when attempting to place one in a panic. 6 AP stacks well with 10 AP of Ink Saver Main in personal experience.
         Overall, this ability is far from necessary, but it can very well come in handy at times.
    </p>
    <p id="iru">
      Although Ink Recovery Up has a fairly negligible effect on your ink tank in small amounts, chargers as a class have a fairly low 
      ink recovery delay after firing a shot. This, coupled with how expensive a single charged shot can be, makes Ink Recovery a decent
       option to consider when building. Keep in mind, though, that in small amounts, Ink Saver Main actually allows you to get more shots
        faster over time than Ink Recovery alone, even when factoring in tank refill.
    </p>
    <p id="rsu">
      While mostly ineffective on most maps due to the weight and strafe speed of the E-Liter, Most players still opt to use Run Speed
       on grate heavy maps such as Arowana, as it typically benefits their movement more than swim speed in those crucial areas of the
        map where they stay the most. As for peeking, consider saving that for Splat Charger. You won’t notice much of a difference 
        with E-Liter.

    </p>
    <p id="ssu">
      Swim Speed Up is arguably one of the strongest abilities to equip for any charger. The main purpose is to reduce the amount of 
      time it takes to reposition to a different vantage point and begin firing again. This also helps to space yourself from risky 
      engagements without having to jump out entirely. E-Liter specifically is also a heavy-weight. This means that Swim Speed Up is
       generally considered more valuable on this weapon than most other chargers because it has much less base movement speed than any 
       other charger. It takes 9 AP to bring the weapon to a middle-weight weapon and 15 AP (5 subs) to reach the base speed of a 
       light-weight weapon. Overall a cheap investment for huge gains in mobility.
    </p>
    <p id="scu">
      Two subs (6 AP) lowers an already startling 170p to 160p, allowing a small investment to be made for a lot more area control.
       Ink Storm and Bubble Blower are great to keep up the pressure and break through choke points. The more often you get your special, 
       the better. Scaling dies down dramatically after 6 AP, though, so apply Special Charge Up to your build wisely.
    </p>
    <p id="ss">
      Although not as effective as a Stingray during a counterpush, Ink Storm and Bubble Blower may very well come in handy when you need 
      it the most. E-Liter paints surprisingly well, so coupled with special Saver, you should have no problem building your special gauge
       to stop your opponents in their tracks. At most, you should invest 3–6 AP. This increases your special saved by just around 60-70%. 
       Typically 12 AP is considered the cutoff, as its most recent buff to its potency wears off at around that amount.
    </p>
    <p id="spu">
      Bubbles scale quadratically, meaning it becomes noticeably bigger and easier to manage with each main added, regardless of how much
       you use. The sweet spot is 20 AP, but some maps could use 30. I do not recommend Special Power Up on the Inkstorm variation, however,
        as its duration is both ineffective for the amount you need to invest as well as limited in terms of how much value you even get out 
        of the extra time it has on the field.
    </p>
    <p id="qr">
      Aggro players sometimes die twice in a row before getting a kill, whereas chargers are the ones meant to help them not die. Really only 
      use this if your team is running it as well. Even then, E-Liter won’t benefit all that much from Quick Respawn and would most likely get 
      more value out of using a Respawn Punisher build instead. 
    </p>
    <p id="qsj">
      Quick Super Jump is a staple ability used in almost all proper gear builds. Its primary use is to jump out of nasty situations where 
      you are flanked or your team is respawning. Just one sub cuts down on your launch time drastically, but 6 AP is widely seen as optimal.
       Some swear on even more than that, but think things over carefully. Typically 12 AP is considered the cutoff, as its most recent buff
        to its potency wears off at around that amount.
    </p>
    <p id="bpu">
      Sub Power Up extends tracking time on Ink Mines and shortens jump duration to Squid Beakons for all teammates. Sub Power Up and Quick
       Super Jump scale similarly in the time it takes to super jump, so just as is recommended with Quick Super Jump, 3–12 AP have a very 
       strong effect. While not necessary, it should at least be considered when building your Custom E-Liter.
    </p>
    <p id="ir">
      Ink Resistance Up is a fairly underutilized ability in general and for good reason. E-Liter is fairly solid at painting its own feet 
      with tap shots. On top of that, the weapon doesn’t ever need to push up into enemy territory all that often, so it rarely finds itself 
      in situations where it needs to traverse enemy ink. Factoring in how much of an investment it takes to even gain a relevant increase 
      in movement, Ink Resistance Up does not fall under any sort of light that makes it worth considering.
    </p>
    <p id="bdef">
      Bomb defense is the standard of almost any build. By investing only 3 AP (1 sub slot), you can easily boost your survivability under a
       number of circumstances. Close indirects from Inkjet and Tenta Missiles become a 3-shot, Baller takes 3 taps to kill, and most of all,
        far chip damage from all bombs—Inkjet and Tenta Missiles included—will never break your armor in one hit without the assistance of an
         outside source. Bomb Defense is an ability you will almost always want to run due to the minuscule investment necessary to reap 
         benefits, especially if you have an Ink Armor in your team comp.
    </p>
    <p id="cb">
      Even if there was a need for Cold-Blooded, an E-Liter is typically in a safe position, away from the brunt of the action where having
       marked a player gains more value.
    </p>
    <p id="og">
      Opening Gambit could really only have a use on Rainmaker maps where your team is likely to get a quick KO. E-Liter gains a ton of 
      value out of Swim Speed Up, but it isn’t worth sacrificing a main ability for a temporary boost at the start of a game. The odds are
       you will lose your Opening Gambit effect fairly early into the match, and that leaves you with an empty slot ability for a vast 
       majority of the game. Consider other exclusive abilities like Tenacity or Comeback instead.
    </p>
    <p id="lde">
      I really don’t see it ever used for E-Liter; but, I can see it working in Splatfest as a literal Last Ditch Effort to win. This may
       also have a use in Splat Zones against team compositions that lock down the zone for long periods of time.
    </p>
    <p id="tena">
      As a backliner, you’re typically the one that dies the least. It’s completely normal for your teammates to go down in a fight. When 
      they do, you will be able to charge your already cheap specials even faster, which can even mean being able to stall for time as your 
      team gets back to you. One teammate dying is typically around 8 seconds towards your meter charging. A fairly strong option for more 
      defensive E-Liters.
    </p>
    <p id="cbk">
        When you —the backliner— dies, that means the enemy team has most likely already gained a sizeable advantage over your team and are 
        free to attempt a push. When paired with the proper abilities, Comeback offers a fantastic boost to your weapon’s efficacy when you 
        need it the most. Even if you’re not dying often. The effects add up throughout the course of a single game. 3 deaths is already a 
        full minute with an extra <em>60 AP</em> worth of abilities!
    </p>
    <p id="ns">
        Ninja Squid doesn’t make all that much sense on E-Liter. When holding a charge, your character still glows, which compromises your 
        location anyway. On top of that, you’re a heavy weight weapon, meaning that alongside making yourself even slower, you’re also reducing
         the stacking efficiency of Swim Speed Up—one of the best abilities for E-Liter. Avoid this ability like the plague.
    </p>
    <p id="haunt">
        For a little as E-Liter tends to die, death usually means you were killed by a flanker, being able to take revenge on such a flank 
        makes Haunt a really good choice for Solo matches where communication isn't utilized often and players don't pay attention to possible
         back-capping going on. On top of that, typically the one to flank and kill the backline would be the main slayer of the opponent’s comp. 
         This allows you to target and call out the main slayer in an organized environment as well.
    </p>
    <p id="thermal">
        Thermal Ink only activates via shots from your main weapon. E-Liter is a one-shot... meaning you won’t exactly be getting much use out 
        of this ability when your target is already dead. Unless you’re using partial charges on someone or they’re wearing armor, there really 
        is no instance in which you will find Thermal Ink useful over abilities like Respawn Punisher or even Haunt. It’s not worth considering 
        in its current state.
    </p>
    <p id="rp">
        Respawn Punisher seems like a match made in heaven. If you are confident in your aim and feel like taking this ability out for a 
        spin, it will definitely pay off! A kill negates 85% of your opponents’ QR and destroys their special meter. Put those pesky 
        frontliners back in their place!
    </p>
    <p id="sj">
      While Stealth Jump helps aggressive players, E-Liters tend to stay back and only jump to someone when there is a jump available far 
      from the frontline. There’s not really a purpose to hide your jump when you are the one being an anchor for your team to jump to.
    </p>
    <p id="objs">
      3.2 saw the buff of E-Liter’s damage towards the Rainmaker barrier, This removed one of the few reasons why you’d run Object Shredder. 
      At this point, it is only used to help manage a Bubble Blower on the field.  Object Shredder on Ink Storm is still decent against armor 
      comps, as it peels it off of your opponents the moment it makes contact with them. However, the Custom E-Liter’s kit gets far more 
      practical use out of Object Shredder because of the hard time it has managing its own bubbles.
    </p>
    <p id="dr">
      Drop Roller is very situational. Although it is more of a gimmick at its core, it can occasionally throw off some players that are 
      camping a jump. You can’t act out of the roll very well with an E-Liter, so this is probably better off sitting in your wardrobe 
      when deciding what gear to wear.
